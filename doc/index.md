A very small 3D printer board for use on a direct drive toolhead. It is designed to be used with Klipper firmware.
Klipper has the awesome feature to be able to use multiple MCUs connected to the host over a (relatively) high latency connection. Using CAN bus it is possible to chain many boards using just a pair of twisted wires and power. A good solution for multiple head 3D printers.
